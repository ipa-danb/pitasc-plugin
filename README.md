# pitasc-plugin package

Replace skill name with description

Press `Ctrl + o` to replace the skill name with its corresponding default skill

Skills should be rendered before with the `python pitasc_boiler_plate.py <additional repos>`.

This creates a file `pitasc.dump`, which is the base for the replace function.
